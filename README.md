# GrapeCity Documents for Excel â€“ Java Edition CTP
GrapeCity introduces Documents for Excel (GcExcel) Java-CTP, a high-speed, feature-rich Excel document API based on VSTO that can help developers work with spreadsheets in Java applications. The library helps to generate, convert to pdf, calculate, format, and parse spreadsheets in any application. You can work with a variety of features like importing spreadsheets, calculate data, query, generate, and export any spreadsheet, add sorting, filtering, formatting, conditional formatting and data validation, grouping, sparklines, charts, shapes, pictures, slicers, comments, hyperlinks, themes etc.  In addition, you can import existing Excel templates, add data and save the spreadsheets back. You can also use GcExcel together with Spread.Sheets, another GrapeCity Spread product that is included in GrapeCity SpreadJS. GcExcel can also import and export Excel template files on the server side. Spread.Sheets works in the browser (client side) as a viewer or editor.

With GcExcel, you can also load, edit, analyse, convert and save spreadsheets in Java applications with full support on Windows, MAC and Linux.
